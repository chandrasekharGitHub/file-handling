We want to realize a program for handling new and used cars to sell.
For each car to sell, the information about the car is stored on a 
text file.

Realize a class Car, to handle a single car. 
Each car is characterized by the following information: 
	model,
	manufacturing year, 
	driven kilometers, 
	and price. 
	
New cars can be distinguished by the fact that the driven 
kilometers are 0.

The class Car should export the following methods:

• a constructor to construct a car object, given all the data 
about the car as parameters;

• suitable get-methods to obtain the data about the car;

• a toString method, which does overriding of the toString method 
inherited from Object, and returns a string containing the data 
about the car;

• boolean equalTo(Car c) : that returns true if the car coincides 
with the car c in all of its data, and false otherwise.

Realize a class CarList, each of whose objects represents a list 
of cars to sell. 

A CarList object does not directly store the data about the cars 
to sell, but maintains the name of a text file in which such 
data are stored, according to the following format:

model
manufacturing year
driven kilometers
price

The class CarList should export the following methods:

• CarList(String filename) : constructor with a parameter of type 
String, representing the name of the file in which the data about 
the cars to sell are stored;

• int countNewCars() : that returns the number of new cars in the 
list of cars to sell;

• Car mostExpensiveCar() : that returns the Car object corresponding
to the most expensive car in the list of cars to sell.

• void addCar(Car c) : that adds the car c to the end of the list 
of cars to sell.

• void remove(Car c) : that removes from the list of cars to sell 
the car whose data coincides with that of c, if such a car is 
present, and leaves the list unchanged otherwise.
